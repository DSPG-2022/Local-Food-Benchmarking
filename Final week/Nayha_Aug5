The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is an immersive summer program that engages students from across Iowa to work together on projects that address local and state government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. Learn more about the program [here](https://dspg.iastate.edu/).

### **Local Food Benchmarking**
The Iowa State Farm Food and Enterprise Development (FEED) is frequently asked for benchmarks on pricing of products both in retail and wholesale spaces. This occurs both within feasibility studies for new farm and food businesses and market assessments, as well as appropriate price points for selling to schools and early care sites, hospitals, universities, and other institutions. There is a need for additional data and research on the potential sales point for these wholesale products when many of our specialty crop producers across the state are operating in direct-to-consumer retail spaces.

Narrowing down the exact products that will be selected for inclusion in the initial market (It is currently anticipated that key products may include strawberries, peppers, cucumbers, sweet corn, melons and apples (rhubarb, honey, preserves, eggs, greens etc. might be current products being sold). If appropriate, this list may also include nuts, mushrooms and hydroponic greens or possibly dairy (local creameries, not AE)
Discuss and identify possible data sources. several potential sources for collecting information have already been identified as preliminary sources. Many of these programs are already program partners with the FEED team.
Investigate the possibility of scraping data about local food prices and availability from social media, e-commerce websites or similar sources (specifically around wholesale distribution) -- Use Google Trends to identify other potential key products by terms being searched for. Potential for geographic scope of searches. -- Explore options for similar searches on Twitter or Facebook (Facebook marketplace) using appropriate API’s -- Local food market place,
Compare the values of the collected data with that provided by the USDA to determine if this process of collecting local data has the potential to better help producers with their decision making. – This might be done in collaboration with data being collected by the other AgMRC commodities DSPG team.
Collect data and develop a public interface as a dashboard showcasing the market benchmarks as a series of interactive visuals.
Identify potential aspects of the project that could be automated for future data collection and continual benchmarking
Investigate and/or demonstrate potential use of AI to help identify impacts to local food markets. For example, weather impacts. Alternatively utilize AI to monitor where there are potential shortages or surpluses of a product in a geographic area.

### **Objectives**
-Narrowing down the exact products that will be selected for inclusion in the initial market 
-Data Discovery: Identify possible data sources
-Investigate the possibility of scraping data from social media, e-commerce websites or similar sources. Use Google Trends to identify other potential key products by terms being searched
-Compare values of collected data with USDA to determine if this process of collecting local data has the potential to better help producers with decision making​
-Identify potential aspects of the project that could be automated for future data collection and continual benchmarking​
-Investigate and/or demonstrate potential use of AI to help identify impacts to local food markets. For example, weather impacts.​

### **Outcomes**
1.Used Google Trends to select the top 5 commodities​
Apple
Strawberries
Pears
Tomatoes
Green Peppers
2.Compared the difference between USDA Vs local/Grocery/Food hubs price data
3.End-to-end data automation process created for data collection (web scraping scheduler)
4.Forecasted the prices and the most important variables affecting the prices using weather and economic factors

### **Project Workflow**
1.Data Collection:​
Web Scraping/Producer’s Data
2.Data Exploration:​
Google Trends Vs Price
3.Finalizing the Top Commodities + Variety + Unit
4.Comparison:​
USDA Vs  local/Grocery/Food hubs price
5.Data Automation:​
Web Scraping Scheduler
6.Forecasting Prices using Weather/Economy indicators

### **Data Collection**
1.Webscraping
The code for webscraping is linked below and the websites scraped in project include:
https://github.com/DSPG-2022/Local-Food-Benchmarking/tree/main/Final%20week
-Hyvee
-Iowa Food Coop
-Wheatsfield Coop
-Walmart
2.Attend Des moines and Ames Farmer Market
-Took pictures of prices and manually extracted into excel files
-Conversations with local farmers coonfirmed that figuring out prices in local economy is difficult
3.Cold calls/Emails
-Sent emails and calls to local producers to gather data

### **Data Exploration **
1.Google Trends
-search for produce keywords and when they peak/probable explanation for peak
-Comparing avg. price and google trends revealed prices are lowest when searches are highest

### **Prioritization **
1.Select Top Products by Google Trends​
Example: Apples, Corn, Cucumbers, Strawberries etc. by Hits 
2.Filter out Products by Area(in acres) for Iowa
3.Select variety/unit by data availability​
Example: Apples have multiple variety like Fuji, Gala, Red Delicious
4.Final Products
Apple (Red Delicious)
Strawberries
Pears
Tomatoes (Heirloom)
Green Peppers

### **Compare **
1.MARKETING CHANNEL FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS
-Direct Channel:producer->consumers
-Wholesale Channel:producer->wholesaler
-Retail Channel:producer->wholesaler->retail->consumers
2. Price Supply Chain
This diagram demonstrates how price of commodities change throughout the supply chain when going through various channels
<Insert Diagram>
3.Price Markup Percentages
This chart demonstrates percent increase of prices with different supllies and channels
4. This graph highlights two key takeaways
-Overtime, farmers are keeping less percentage share of price while retailers are gaining more percentage share of price
-Local economy is much more affected by economic downturns than national economy
5.Farm share vs Marketing Share
-Buy local allows farmers to keepp more of their share
-Buy retails spends more on marketing share and less is kept by farmer

### **Data Automation **
1.Python and Postman Scheduler
-Created a python scheduler to scrape websites periodically to create historical price data

### **Forecasting using Artifical intelligence and Machine Learning **
1. Predict future commodity prices using economic indicators and weather data
2. Utilized Linear Regression model as it is computationally efficent
3. Model is 85% accurate
4. Model is highly versatile and can be used to predict local food prices in the future

### **Data**
The indicators were computed using public data-sets obtained from different sources/agencies. Number of available years and granularity of the data varied across sources. Data sources for few indicators were not identified, therefore the project team could not compute the corresponding indicators. Detailed information about sources used can be found [here](https://iastate.app.box.com/file/844461079162?s=wsb68re1hs0qgnfba6r5lupx59hdvwip).
